<h3>GNUe Application Server version 2 kick-off</h3>
<p>2nd March 2002</p>
<p>My personal notes on the kick-off discussions for GNUe Application Server version 2 - held on the IRC channel on Thursday 28th February - are now available <a href="http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/geasv2.html">on the web</a>. (This is effectively a sneak preview of what will be in GNUe Kernel Cousins #19 when I finish it next week.)</p>
