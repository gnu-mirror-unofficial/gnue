<h3>Financial Industry Says Good Bye To Force Fed Standards</h3>
<p>10th September 2001</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com">Infoworld</a> has an interesting <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/articles/fe/xml/01/09/10/010910fetrend.xml">article</a> on the standardization of financial formats particularly using XML techonologies.  I am amazed that business people are starting to 'vividly' put things in perspective.  Such as this quote, "Companies like Reuters realize that they can no longer shove their proprietary standards down customers' throats." and more importantly that writers are reporting on it.  Im curious what are the biggest 'vendor standards' that are impeding your business currently?  EDI jumps to mind for me, but how about the rest of us?</p>
