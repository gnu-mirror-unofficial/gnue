<h3>Kernel Cousins GNUe 3 now out</h3>
<p>17th November 2001</p>
<p><p>Title says it all, really, except for a reminder of the URL : <a href="http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/latest.html">http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/latest.html</a>. Many thanks to Zack Brown for all his help with this.</p>

<br />

<p>Zack has also set up two mailing lists : kcgnueannounce, which has new issue announcements and kcgnuedistrib, which has the new issues themselves. You can subscribe to either of these at <a href="http://kt.zork.net/lists.html">http://kt.zork.net/lists.html</a>.</p></p>
