<h3>Super Computer's Down But Not Out</h3>
<p>19th July 2001</p>
<p>There is an interesting <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/07/18/188256&mode=thread">article</a> at <a href="http://www.newsforge.com">newsforge</a> about the return of the super computer.  Working for an institution that owns an OS/390, I will say that the momentum has definitely started to shift.  With GNU|Linux getting support on higher end systems like the OS/390 and with the movement towards good clustering like BeoWolf and MissionCritical Linux it will be interesting to see where this trend goes.  I hope to do some clustering testing here at work via our internal users group, has anyone else started to explore this?</p>
