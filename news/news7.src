<h3>Data Quality Critical to Success</h3>
<p>15th June 2001</p>
<p>Recently much focus from enterprises has gone into doing Customer Relationship Management and really putting the power of their past and current customer information to work.  There is an <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/eweek/stories/general/0,11011,2769114,00.html">article</a> on ZDNet stating how as this information is more broadly used in a number of systems that its becoming glaringly obvious that the quality of much of the data is poor.  <i>I think this has long been a problem and often debated, many times it is deemed too expensive to clean up the data properly.  I am curious as to what others are doing to help insure the integrity of thier data.  What are ways we can avoid these issues in GNU Enterprise?</i></p>
