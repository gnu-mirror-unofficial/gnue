<h3>Data Junction To Provide GNU|Linux Port</h3>
<p>13th June 2001</p>
<p>It appears as though Data Junction, a data integration engine, plans on providing a GNU|Linux port by Q3 2001.  Along with this port will come support for databases like <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a>.  They will not be supporting <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> at this time, but are considering it.  Such tools could make the transition of corporate data stores off of closed systems and databases much easier.  You can read more about it <a href="http://www.101com.com/elx/article.asp?articleid=3898">here</a>.</p>
