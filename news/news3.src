<h3>Release the Power of the Portal</h3>
<p>11th June 2001</p>
<p>CTO's have long been belaboring the point that Portals are the way to put a singular interface on a corporations disparate datasources.  However, this <a href="http://iwsun4.infoworld.com/articles/fe/xml/01/06/11/010611feknowledge.xml">article</a> puts a slightly different spin on things.  It explains that just showing in a web browser multiple types of company data isnt enough.  That the underlying systems really need to talk as well to make things useful.  There is also talk of using portals as collaboration vehicles for enterprises spread out physically.  Many of the items are similar to the development styles found in the Free Software movement which has produced software like GNULinux.</p>
