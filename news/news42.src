<h3>Sorry for the down time....</h3>
<p>29th November 2001</p>
<p>We apologize for the intermittent down time during the past two days.  An debian upgrade caused some unstableness, that required some fixing that wasnt able to be done remotely, so we experienced poor connectivity on and off during past two days.  Things should be well once again, please note we did have some DNS issues as well, they should be resolved, but if for any reason you experience problems with the site, cvs, mailing lists, etc please assume we do not know the problem exists and email info@gnue.org.  Thanks to all who help make GNUe such a great project to contribute too.</p>
