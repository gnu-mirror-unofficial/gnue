<h3>The Software Industry Is Changing</h3>
<p>29th June 2001</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnet.com">CNet</a> is running a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-201-6375299-0.html?tag=tp_pr">story</a> on Oracle and reviewing how their world is shifting based on things happening in the industry.  I think that Oracle and Microsoft are two shining examples of how things in the industry are playing out currently.  With the influx of Open/Free licensing, fed up customers and a weak economy, the days of upgrade at several hundred dollars a seat every 6 months to a year for marginal features is over.  The question is where will the chips fall.  Seems the big boys are wanting to shift licensing costs into servicers or Application Service Providers (ASP).  However, the public thus far hasnt been biting.  So to force them to bite they are changing all thier software to work only in such environments.  How are you as an Enterprise liking this shift?</p>
