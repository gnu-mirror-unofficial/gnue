<h3>GNUe Starts Process of Becoming Open Source Development Lab Project</h3>
<p>8th July 2001</p>
<p>Both GNU Enterprise as a whole and Bayonne, a GNUe sub-project, are in the process of becoming Open Source Development Lab projects.  The <a href="http://www.osdlab.com">Open Source Development Lab </a>(OSDL) for those that dont know, is a lab setup by all of the major hardware players in the industry to donate high availability enterprise level hardware to open source projects for testing.  If approved this will mean GNUe and Bayonne will have top end multi processor / clustering machines available to do testing on.  You can see our OSDL status <a href="http://www.osdlab.com/projects/project_status.shtml">here</a> and our OSDL project info <a href="http://www.osdlab.com/projects/project_info.shtml">here</a>.</p>
