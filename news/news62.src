"Manufacturing organizations must always deal with determining how to balance on-hand part inventories and

suppliers' response times. 









<br />









<br />

This article describes a project called

    supply chain, which focused on characterizing the various

stochastic events influencing a manufacturing organization's

shipment and inventory performance. A collection of statistical

modeling assumptions, equations, and equation derivations are

described that focus on minimizing on-hand inventory and











<br />

optimizing supplier response time.

The

Supply Chain Approach to Planning and Procurement

Management











<br />









<br />

The supply chain

approach models stochastic events influencing a manufacturingo rganization's shipment and inventoryp erformance in the same

way that a mechanical engineer models tolerance buildup in a

new product design. The objectives are to 









<br />

minimize on-hand

inventory and optimize supplier response times.

I hope the above info will give them a run for their money when GNUE is ready to take them on. - BobP.
