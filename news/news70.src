It is with much excitement we announce this very big step.  We have begun using DCL for our internal project management already and are loving it.  There will be some GNUe Front-Ends available to DCL very soon, some already exist in the DCL cvs tree.  We are working out the issues of website, cvs and such as we go so please be patient.</p>
