<h3>Vendors Deeming All Customers Created Equally</h3>

<p>After years of getting 'volume pricing' and other kick backs from vendors, for the first time Enterprise customers are experiencing the same woes thier smaller counterparts have for years.  Negotiating software licensing has become more and more difficult as software companies see thier draconian licensing models crumbling before them.  Many Enterprises refuse to pay full price and/or be held hostage to upgrade demands.
