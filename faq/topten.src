<h1>Top Ten Questions</h1><h2>to ask your proprietary ERP salesman</h2><p>At one time, Oracle used to make a feature of &quot;Top Ten Questions&quot; for prospective buyers to ask salesman of whoever they perceived as their biggest competitor at the time. I wondered what a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnue/">GNU Enterprise</a> equivalent might look like...</p><p>To be fair, I recognise many of the GNUe answers are aspirational rather than as of time of writing (1st January 2002). However, as I understand it, this is where we are aiming for.</p><hr><h3>1. I'm paying how much and I'm not allowed to know how it works?</h3><p>Proprietary ERP vendors are unusual amongst proprietary software vendors, in that they often allow you some access to some technical documentation about the software (e.g. database schemas). However, this information may be limited, and may be subject to non-disclosure agreements and impractical constraints (e.g. required to keep paper technical reference manuals under lock and key).</p><p>With GNU Enterprise, all the source code is freely available to you under the GNU Public License (GPL). You can see what the system does, and how it does it. You can use GNU Enterprise as a basis for writing your own packages. You can either keep these for yourself, or share them with others under the GPL.</p><p>You can, if required, prove system integrity to your Auditors by examining the source code for backdoors and trojans, and compile it from source. If you get your GNU Enterprise executables from a reputable source (e.g. the GNU Enterprise website), this shouldn't be a problem, but some highly secure organisations might require this level of assurance.</p><p>Also, all the documentation for the system is available under the GPL Documentation License. You can use GNU Enterprise documentation as the basis for your own internal manuals, or put it on your intranet or extranet, all without needing anyone's permission or paying any additional fees.</p><h3>2. Am I too small for your package?</h3><p>Most proprietary ERP vendors target their offerings at large enterprises. You might think that this is because only large enterprises can truly benefit from ERP. The reality is that SMEs (small to medium enterprises) can benefit just as much from a fully integrated ERP system as their bigger brethren. The reason proprietary ERP vendors target large enterprises is because they are the only oneswho can afford proprietary ERP vendors.</p><p>Some ERP vendors are now targeting SMEs with service offerings, where you access the software over the internet for a monthly fee. This is similar in principle to the ASP (Application Service Provider) service that they offer as an option to larger enterprises. However, this means that you do not control the hardware, or your business-critical data.</p><p>GNU Enterprise is fully scalable in both directions. It is possible for an SME to run GNU Enterprise on a single, normal desktop PC, giving them the benefits of full, integrated, ERP. As the business grows, so can the system, with the addition of further hardware and network connectivity - but still the same software. </p><p>As larger business look towards closer supply chain integration with their small and medium sized business partners, being able to support the e-business standards your biggest customer uses could become a critical business advantage.</p><h3>3. What happens if my level of activity increases?</h3><p>Many proprietary ERP vendors have moved away from user-based licensing,in order to better fit the reality of web-based self-service, where the number of users can be indeterminate. However, you will still be licensed for the software on some sort of activity basis - number of transactions or size of server(s) are common ones.</p><p>With GNU Enterprise, if your business doubles in size, it still won't be cost-free. You will probably need more or new hardware, connectivityand maybe some extra consultancy to get everything working together. But the software license still costs the same (i.e. nothing) - after all, it hasn't changed.</p><h3>4. What standards do you support, and how are they licensed?</h3><p>Proprietary ERP vendors have started to take standards more seriously over the past few years, mainly due to customer demand. Some proprietary ERP systems now support multiple databases. Most proprietary ERP systems are starting to support standards like XML for information interchange.</p><p>GNU Enterprise has been designed from the start to support standards,both current and future. Standards that are currently supported include { $$$ } </p><p>GNU Enterprise also supports a wide range of databases, including free software ones such as Postgresql, MySQL and SAP-DB, and fully proprietary ones such as Oracle and IBM DB/2.</p><p>GNU Enterprise has also made a conscious decision to avoid depending on standards which are proprietary, such as Java (owned by Sun). You can use proprietary standards with GNU Enterprise if you want to, but there will always be a non-proprietary equivalent.</p><h3>5. How does this work with the stuff I already have?</h3><p>Proprietary ERP vendors encourage you to see their system as an &quot;all or nothing&quot; proposition. Some of them even charge license fees as a single cost for all modules, regardless of which ones you intend using, in an attempt to lock you in to the product. They may even use the term &quot;free&quot; to describe this. It would be more accurate to describe this as a sunk cost in license fees for proprietary software.</p><p>GNU Enterprise is a much more heterogeneous business solution. As with any ERP package, you will get the full benefits of end-to-end integration in the easiest way by implementing as much of it as is relevant to your enterprise. However, because of its commitment to standards, you should find it much easier to integrate one part of GNU Enterprise with other business systems. For example, you might want tointegrate GNU Supply Chain Management and CRM with your existing proprietary finance package doing Accounts Receivable and General Ledger.</p><p>In addition, GNU Enterprise includes GNUe Integrator, a tool specifically designed to transfer data from and to the GNUe environment. Unlike some other ERP vendor's interfaces, this works using flexible XML definitions rather than pre-defined flat file formats, and can work in real time as well as in batch.</p><h3>6. What level of support will I get?</h3><p>Proprietary ERP vendors offer a limited range of support options. These are usually geared towards larger enterprises, and priced accordingly. You can usually only get your support from one source, either the system supplier or their designated reseller (who may be acting as first-line support for the system supplier). Poor support is one of the most common criticisms enterprises have of their ERP vendor. Although your vendor may offer &quot;guaranteed&quot; support response speeds, you may find that it is difficult to enforce these without jeopardising your overall relationship with them.</p><p>With GNU Enterprise, you can run without a support contract altogetherif you want to. You have access to the source code, and may have the in-house skills to resolve any problems you run into. If bug fixes are made to the official release, you can download them and apply themyourself. You can also choose not to apply bug fixes that are not relevant to you if you prefer.</p><p>However, most organisations will probably feel more comfortable paying for a support package from a consultancy firm. You may want your consultants to provide you with a wide range of services, including hardware and networking support, as well as GNU Enterprise applicationssupport. You may need 24/7/365 access to a large, multi-skilled, support team, and be prepared to pay accordingly. Or you may just need a friendly voice at the end of a phone line or internet address on an occasional basis. You pay for the level of support you need.</p><p>If your GNU Enterprise support is not up to scratch, get rid of them and find another one.</p><h3>7. What happens if I want to customise the package?</h3><p>Proprietary ERP vendors are unusual amongst proprietary software vendors, in that they often positively encourage you to customise the application - usually by paying them to write a customisation for you. Of course, you will never be aware if they have already written an identical or similar package for another customer - it will always be charged to you as if they had had to write it from scratch. You are also then dependant on the vendor to check that the customisation is compatible with any future upgrades.</p><p>To be fair, several vendors have now discovered some of the problems involved in supporting customisations. Their response has been to try to convince you to do without customisation altogether, and mould your business processes to their software. It may well be, especially if your organisation hasn't used an ERP package before, that your business processes could do with an extensive review, and this should be encouraged. But let's be clear - they want you to adopt different business practices not because they are &quot;best practice,&quot; but because they fit their software.</p><p>GNU Enterprise offers an alternative way of providing customised functionality, via the use of Templates. Templates are ways of customising a module or modules, for example for a particular industry. Templates can add or remove fields from the database, add extra business rules to objects, or even add whole business processes. But all in a way that is standardised, and which will survive any future upgrades. You can apply existing templates, or write your own, or modify those that other have written.</p><p>Templates also provide a way of providing internationalisation. With a development team spread across different continents, GNU Enterprise has been designed from the start as an internationallyaware product. It is not a U.S.-centric (or any other centric) product, where specific functionality for other countries has been bolted on afterwards.</p><p>Of course, if you want to customise GNU Enterprise by editing and recompiling the source code, you can do so. For extensive customisations, this may be the only way. However, you should look at using templates first.</p><h3>8. What happens if you go bust?</h3><p>Proprietary ERP vendors often have elaborate &quot;escrow&quot; arrangements, which allow you access to the source code if they go out of business or if other key &quot;trigger&quot; events happen.</p><p>With GNU Enterprise, you have the source code up front. If your GNU Enterprise consultancy firm goes out of business, find another one, or get the skills in-house to manage the product.</p><h3>9. What happens if you get taken over?</h3><p>It is not uncommon for proprietary ERP vendors to acquire other ERP vendors. Sometimes this will be to &quot;cherry-pick&quot; bits of the 'intellectual property' of the target. Often, the real asset they are buying is the customer base of the other vendor, who will find their old system becoming unsupported, with varying degrees of pressure to move onto the vendor's main package.</p><p>GNU Enterprise is not 'owned' by anyone. The copyright is held by the Free Software Foundation, but this is just to allow them to uphold the freedoms of all users under the GPL. If, hypothetically, every GNUEnterprise consultancy firm went out of business, and everyone else stopped using it, you still have everything you need (including the source code) to continue supporting yourself.</p><h3>10. What happens if we don't get on?</h3><p>Proprietary ERP vendors don't always sell their product direct. Your salesman may be working for a &quot;partner&quot; of the ERP vendor. That partner may have monopoly rights to your geographical area, or market sector. If your relationship with the vendor or reseller breaks down, you may have no choice but to ditch the system and move to another vendor.</p><p>With GNU Enterprise, you are always in control. Subject to contract, you can walk away from your current GNU Enterprise consultant or consultancy firm, and either find another one, or get the skills in-house to manage the product. What's more, your GNU Enterprise consultant knows this as well. GNU Enterprise consultants stay in business by providing a professional service to their customers, not by (ab)using their monopoly power over your investment in &quot;their&quot; system.</p><h3>11. How often must I upgrade?</h3><p>Proprietary ERP vendors will often insist that you upgrade the system on a regular basis. This may even be written into the contract. Some ERP clients have been subject to several mandatory upgrades over just a few years, from terminal (&quot;green screen&quot;) products, to client-server PC-based products then on again to web-based products, with extra hardware costs each step of the way. Although upgrades may be &quot;free&quot; (i.e. there is no additional license fee cost), there may be additional consultancy costs in doing the upgrade. There will certainlybe internal costs and disruption. You may also have to re-train a large number of end-users.</p><p>With GNU Enterprise, there are no mandatory upgrades. Both the core GNU Enterprise developers and your GNU Enterprise consultants (if any) would encourage you to update on a regular basis, and your GNUEnterprise consultants might make upgrade assistance part of your overall support arrangements with them. However, you are at liberty to ignore this advice. You are the only one who can make the decision about what is best for your enterprise, including balancing all the internal and external costs.</p><p>Note that GNU Enterprise supports both two-tier (client-server) and n-tier (client-applications server-database serve) architectures. You can use the same application - even the same form - on different types of client in the same installation. So you could have a mixture of graphical PC-based users, web-based HTML users and old character terminals all at the same time. (The only constraints are those of the underlying hardware, e.g. you cannot display graphics on a character-based device.) This flexibility removes a lot of the costs associated with upgrades that also involve changes in architecture.</p><p>Also note that the license fee cost for an upgrade of GNU Enterprise is the same as for the original software, i.e. free.</p><h3>12. What happens if the needs of my business don't match the features of your software?</h3><p>I've heard that most proprietary ERP providers have the philosophy that &quot;Ifyour business doesn't match the features of our software, change yourbusiness.&quot;  This works if the business uses information in a very genericway.  But it is a particularly important concern if the way the businessuses information is part of the business's competitive edge.</p><p>I heard of an instance with one ERP package where a major manufacturerreviewed the package and found that the package was based on theirprincipal competitor's way of doing business.  It turned out that thismanufacturer's competitive edge was based on their using informationdifferenly from the way the competitor used it.  Of course, they rejecteduse of the ERP package.</p><p>With GNUe, we provide the tools and you can use what you want and tailorthe remainder to match the needs of your way of doing business.  All thesource code is available, so you can change anything you want.</p><p>IF you distribute the code for your changes to others, you are obligated tomake the source code to your changes freely available, but this appliesONLY if you distribute your changes to others.  If you make changes onlyfor your internal purposes - you aren't required to distribute them to anyone.</p><hr><p>That's actually 12 questions, but then you always get more than you expect with free software ;-)</p>
