<h1>GNUe Forms (Native GTK2 client)</h1>

<p>The Native GTK2 Forms client accesses the 
GTK2 GUI (Graphical User Interface) directly 
rather than via the wxGTK/wxpython toolkit.</p>

<p>This client is fairly mature, as it re-uses 
most of the code from the reference (wxpython) 
version, with a few patches to use the GTK2 
toolkit rather than wxpython.</p>
