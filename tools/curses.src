<h1>GNUe Forms (Curses/text-only client)</h1>

<p>Not all Forms users will have access to the 
latest computer hardware, or even a modern 
GUI (Graphical User Interface) system. The 
curses interface is designed to provide a way 
of displaying usable versions of GNUe Forms 
Definitions (.gfds) on character-only devices, 
such as "green-screen" terminal display units.</p>
