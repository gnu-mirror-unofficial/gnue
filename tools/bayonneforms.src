<h1>GNUe Forms (Bayonne client)</h1>

<p>The aim of the Bayonne Forms client is to 
interface with <a href="bayonne.html">Bayonne</a>, 
the GNU telephony project, to provide a means for 
users to access standard GNUe Forms Definitions (.gfds) 
via the phone, either using touch-tones or voice 
prompts. This allowing anyone with a phone to access 
and update data in your GNUe Applications.</p>
