<h3>GNUe RPMs</h3>

<p>05 February 2003</p>
<p>Available for download at 
<a href ="http://home.attbi.com/~ejarvi/">home.attbi.com/~ejarvi/</a>
are GNUe RPM packages of the last releases. They were built on 
Redhat 8.0. Testing, results, feedback on other RPM based distros 
appreciated.  (I'm unable to post to the mailing list due to spam 
filtering, hence this message.)
