A business application software product is a documented set
of tools to capture, validate and archive business transactions and
to subsequently transform historical data into meaningful information
for decision making and the guidance of an enterprise.</A>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The definition, assessment and ranking of quality attributes are essential
for the development of a first class software product.</LI>
<LI>Project leaders will be aware of the most wanted attributes and consequently
will devote more resources to these attributes.</LI>

are met, and that the other attributes are optimized based on available
time and resources.</LI>

The spectrum of quality attributes

<P>
There are four aspects of quality to consider when evaluating a business
application software. 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Quality of conformance,</LI>
<LI>Quality of design,</LI>
<LI>Quality of documentation,</LI>
<LI>Quality of performance.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Quality of conformance is concerned with the customer needs and requirements.
Quality of conformance is typically defined by the user/customer in
terms of : accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ease of use, flexibility,
uniformity, relevance, consistency, reliability and affordability.

<P>
 
<B><I>Quality of design</I></B> is concerned with the architecture/structure
of the application.

<P>
 
<B><I>Quality of documentation</I></B> is concerned with training
, learning, explaining how to use and how to access information about
the product.

<P>
 
<B><I>Quality of performance</I></B> is concerned with speed of
execution, throughput, productivity, efficiency, limitation, response
time.

<B><I>Data integrity</I></B>

<P>
Integrity is the state of being complete or undivided according to

says ?

<P>
Does the documentation use the language of the trade ?

<P>
 
<B><I>Conciseness</I></B> :

2.3 Quality of performance</A>
</H2>

<P>
 
<B><I>Efficiency</I></B> refers to the amount of computing resources
and code required by a program to perform a function.

<P>
Efficiency is derived from the structure of the data base, the simplicity
and scarcity of the procedures, the quality of the coding.

<P>
 
<B><I>Throughput</I></B> measures the number of business transactions,
a given machine can capture, validate and store per unit of time.
Throughput is dependent of the power of the machine, the operating
system and the efficiency of the application.

<P>
 
<B><I>Productivity</I></B> measures the number of business transactions
a given user can capture, validate and store per unit of time.

<P>
Productivity is derived from the ergonomics of the human interface
and the efficiency of the application.

<P>
 
<B><I>Limitations :</I></B>

Definition</A>
</H3>

<P>
 
<B><I>Ergonomics of the structures.</I></B>

<P>
Is the structure of the data base concomitant with the nature of the
trade ?

<P>
Is the structure of the tables a true reflection of the structure
of the business transaction considered ?

<P>
Are the names of the tables explicit to the experts of the trade?

<P>
Are the names of fields explicit to the experts of the trade ?

<P>
A data base Guru once said :

<P>
If you can not give a table a name meaningful to your end-user, chances
are that this table is useless or ill conceived and the same is true
for every field of the table.

<P>
Programming business application involves zillions of references to
table names and field names. Explicit table and field names increase
greatly the comprehensibility of the code.

<P>
 
<B><I>Simplicity of the structures :</I></B>

<P>
A minimum number of tables. A minimum number of fields. A minimum
number of composite joins. Consider a bit of redundancy in order to
achieve more simplicity.

<P>
Moving data is always done at the expense of integrity.

<P>
 
<B><I>Readability of the code :</I></B>

<P>
What is the effort required to understand the intended functions of
a program ?

<P>
Readability is derived from the structure of the code, the size of
the code, the documentation of the code.

<P>
 
<B><I>Explicitness of the code</I></B> <I>: </I>

<P>
The extent to which a program is readily understandable by sheer use
of meaningful wording for its variables, functions, tables and fields.

<P>
 
<B><I>Consistency of the code :</I></B>

<P>
Does the code look the same and use the same conventions and structures
all across the different modules and procedures?

<P>
 
<B><I>Size of the code :</I></B>

<P>
The amount of man generated code versus machine generated code.

locate and fix an error in an operational program.

<P>
 
<B><I>Testability :</I></B> the effort required to test a program
to ensure it performs its intended functions.

<P>
 
<B><I>Flexibility :</I></B> the effort required to modify an operational
program.

<P>
 
<B><I>Reusability :</I></B> the extent to which a program can
be used in other applications - related to the packaging and scope
