>    GNU Enterprise is a meta-project aimed at developing a complete enterprise level business environment.  It will consist of tools to quickly build business applications.  Several packages and modules will be available ready for out of the box use or readily available to extend or customize to your needs.  There will be templates by industry type so you are only getting the base of what your industry type would use.

	  </P
><P
>        This solution is better than a shrink-wrapped solution. The software is usually tailored to the exact business needs. It does have a few drawbacks however. The software is tied to a specific consultant or company, usually by copyright, in the same manner as shrink wrapped software. If the consultant closes down their business, their customers can be left without any means of support. If source code is not available the system can't be maintained. If the source code is available, a new consultant must be paid to learn the entire system before maintenance is possible. The unique nature of the system has left the business vulnerable.
      </P
><P
>        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Maintain an in-house programming team</I
>
	  </P
><P
>	
         This solution is better than paying a consultant if a business can afford the personnel needed to maintain the systems. But hiring only a single programmer leaves a business in the same position as with a consultant. Many smaller companies cannot afford several full-time programmers. The unique nature of the code requires all development and testing to be done in-house.  Since the software isn't usually shared outside the business it doesn't get the levels of peer review needed to achieve the highest quality.
      </P
><P
>        None of these solutions provide a business with the security and freedom they deserve.  Often businesses find themselves making compromises in their business practices and paying large sums of money to vendors they don't particularly care for simply because they are "locked in" to a specific solution.

><P
>GNU Enterprise objects are defined at application run-time.  This allows a system 
to be easily and rapidly modified by end users without risk of compromising 
the core system.
      </P
><P
>A technically savvy business owner can browse a list of
modules from a library on the GNU Enterprise site.  She
can pick various packages and modules that are of interest, install them via 
a tool like RPM, check out their features, remove the ones she doesn't like, 
finish up her testing and go live.  As new packages and modules become 
available she can add and remove them as she desires (within reason).  
She ends up with a system that is exactly
to her liking w/o the expense of hiring a consultant to customize the
system. 	
      </P
><P
>To achieve maximum modularity and be all things to all people within reason, GNUe is looking at the following approach.  GNUe will be a set of tools to build business applications.  With these tools modules will be built.  Modules will be bundled by similar function to create packages.  One problem in doing this is the different needs of different industries.  A doctor has a very different billing situation than car dealer ship for instance.  Therefore, there will be "templates" by vertical industry if need be.  The concept is GNUe-&#62;Packages-&#62;Modules-&#62;Components  where components can be reused among modules.  Modules are bundled by type ex: accounts recievable, accounts payable, general ledger are bundled in accounting package.  Then multiple packages make up GNUe.  Then each vertical industry can have specific templates if desired to make customization minimal from set up to setup. (Further documentation and flow charts coming on this subject.)

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Open Architecture</I
>
	  </P
><P
>Every effort has been made to open the GNU Enterprise system to developers and users.
CORBA provides a clean interface to the objects that comprise a functional
GNU Enterprise system.  All data is stored in a relational database system.
The database structures are well documented and accessible via standard
SQL.  XML is used to define forms that are parsed and executed by a wide variety 
of clients.

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Powerful Development Framework</I
>
	  </P
><P
>The base distribution of GNU Enterprise will contain several powerful tools.  Tools 
like GNUE Forms, GNUE Reports, GEDI, GEAS and EWOK will allow developers to rapidly develop GNU Enterprise 
applications. 
      </P
><P
>        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Consistency</I
>
	  </P
><P
>   Widespread deployment of GNU Enterprise will allow programmers to become familiar with
   the core GNU Enterprise components.  They should require little time to get up to speed on a specific 
   company's modifications to the code. This frees the programmer from learning the details of a unique
   system that is useless to them in other jobs. They can spend more time doing what they
   enjoy, writing code to solve unique problems.
      </P
><P
>        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Freedom from Single Source Vendors</I
>
	  </P
><P
>   A consultant can assure their customer that in the event they were unable to maintain the
   software it would be easy to find others familiar with the core system. This also provides
   the business some assurance that the consultant won't hold a monopoly on their
   systems, that they are free to let others work on their code.  	  
      </P
><P
>        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Easy Maintenance</I
>
	  </P
><P
>   Since modules are used to store alterations to the system.  Modifications 
   made by the end site are stored separately
   from the generic distribution.  Updates to the generic system can be applied
   without effecting local changes.  Consultants need not maintain several
   virtually identical source trees with individual customer alterations, simple
   modules store all the changes.
      </P
><P
>        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Package Library</I
>
	  </P
><P
>   A person setting up an GNU Enterprise system would have access to growing
   number of packages for the system. These packages could be specialized for
   specific areas of business (manufacturing, legal, etc.) and would allow a programmer to
   produce a fairly specialized system in short period of time then tweak the system to meet
   the exact needs of the business.

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Versioning System</I
>
	  </P
><P
>Due to the modular nature of GNU Enterprise care must be taken to ensure that 
packages are compatible with one another.  To ensure this level of compatibility
every package and object must register it version level upon installation.
This allows other packages and objects to specify which items, and versions of those
items, that they are dependent upon.  
      </P
><P
>        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Best Practices</I
>
	  </P
><P
>Because GNUe will be in use in a wide variety of industrys and will have influence from many developers as well as many users best practices will be developed.  This allows companies new to the digital age or just forming to see how some well established companies are using technology and to build off their successes if they wish.  In the future we see possibility of GNUe user groups as well as GNUe conferences and/or GNUe team showing presence at open source conferences.
      </P

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Internationalization</I
>
	  </P
><P
>GNUe already has representation on development team from Austria, Spain, Belgium, Norway, Finland, Estonia, United States and others.  Which guarantees strong support for both foreign currencies, multi-languages (docs and applications) as well as 24/7 developer end user support and close proximity for conference / user group attendance.  Something not even large scale ERP products are doing well.

></H3
><P
>We'll start with a very high level demo which involves the sale of an item from inventory.
The sale of this item has caused the inventory levels to drop below the reorder point 
(in this example there are no parts kept in stock so reorder point is zero) 
      </P
><P
>   The entry of the sale into GNU Enterprise would cause the inventory system to review the part. 
      </P
><P
>   The inventory levels are too low so either a purchase order could be automatically
   generated or the purchasing department could be notified with a request for purchase. 
      </P
><P
>   Once the order is placed with the vendor the system tracks these tentative parts so that
   additional sales can be processed with approximated ship dates. 
      </P
><P
>   When the parts arrive, their entry into the system alerts the shipping department with a
   list of orders that can now successfully be shipped. Accounting is notified that the order
   has been received and vendor payment is acceptable.  The delivery efficiency of the vendor is
   tracked based upon the vendors promised delivery date vs the actual date of product arrival.
      </P
><P
>   The shipment of the parts cause an invoice to be generated of the accounting
   department that the customer should invoiced.
