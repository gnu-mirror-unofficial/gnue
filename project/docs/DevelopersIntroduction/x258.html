>Applications can be broken down into two types, those that
provide a user interface and those that do not.
	</P
><P
>For applications that provide a UI this would be the logic behind
the interface. It doesn't contain any business logic in most cases,
that's one layer down. It contains the processes that occur when a
trigger is fired from the ICL (button X is pressed, app
has requested shutdown, menu item Y selected, etc.)
	</P
><P
>If all ICLs support a standard set of form widgets, and a standard
set of functions like get_functions required to provide a list of
defined functions in the application. It seems possible to develop a
nice IDE for simple apps along the lines of VB.
	</P
><P
>An application could also be written at this level that would
"simulate" the old SQL*Forms program (with all it's flaws and
bonuses). It would bypass the lower levels and would make a nice
GUI builder for direct table access (something we should
probably avoid, but someone, somewhere will need it)
	</P
><P
>Most developers new to GNUe would work in at this level
using only the higher level business objects and the IDE.
	</P
><P
>The other type of applications would be applications that
perform basic batch style processing on the GNUe objects.

>These programs are basically identical regardless of what
language/platform they cover. They assume a certain number of
procedures are available from applications. One of the most
important would be a "get_ui" call that would tell the application
to send a description of the form to be drawn (encoded in XML).
These programs would handle mapping UI widgets we've defined as
valid for an OBE user
interface. Things like entries, labels, lists, picture, text, notebook
tabs, triggers, etc.
