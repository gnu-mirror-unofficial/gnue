>GNUe Forms</A
></H2
><P
>  GnuE Forms actually consists of two separate programs.  A designer
  which generates user interface definition files and a 
  client which displays screens and accepts input from the user.
	</P
><P
>The GnuE Forms painter provides developers with a system 
that allows rapid development of data entry screens.  A 
developer simply chooses the objects and fields of interest
and arranges the interface widgets to their liking.  The 
system then generates a XML based interface definition file
that is used by the clients.
	</P
><P
>The GNUe Forms client reads the interface definition file
produced by the designer and generates a data entry screen based 
upon its contents. 
	</P
><P
>Since the interface definition file is simple XML text it is very portable.
Clients can be written for any number of display and data entry technologies
and all utilize the same interface definition file.  Thus building a 
single screen via the desinger instantly makes it available to all 
clients.
	</P
><P
>In addition programs can be written to communicate directly with a 
client using its XML interface definition language.  This allows 
programmers to bypass limitations of the screen designer while
retaining the robust, standardized front end clients.

></H2
><P
>GNUe Reports shares many features with GNUe Forms.  It is comprised
of a report designer and a client that generates the requested output.
Report definition files are also XML based.  And programs can communicate
directly with the XML reports definition language much like they can
with GNUe Forms.

>Data abstraction layer.  Allows single API to all data sources.  So the client has one set of calls it uses, but can access different vendors databases or even CVS or XML files.  Similar to Borland's Database Engine or other data abstraction tiers.  It will encompass much more than that and a proposal is forth coming.
