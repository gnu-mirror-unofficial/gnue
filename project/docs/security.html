rules.  There is often a fine line between enforcement of business
rules and enforcement of security policies.  GNUe will not itself
provide advanced levels of assurance in enforcement of security
policies.  If such advanced levels of assurance are needed &ndash;
for example, if they are required as a result of  external
obligations -- GNUe will facilitate use of the advanced assurance
security services and security policy implementation capabilities
provided by the operating system and DBMS.  Implementing advanced
assurance security functions will require that the user select an
operating system and DBMS that provides such functions at the level
of assurance appropriate to the user's needs.  It is also recognized
that some security policies may need to be implemented using
paperwork and manual procedures.</FONT></P>

provide the appropriate infrastructure, together with user
guidelines, necessary to enable users to meet legal obligations and

determined by the enterprises that use GNUe. The guidelines will be
organized into a set of security levels, appropriate to the
anticipated needs of various categories of users.</FONT></P>

overview of security</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The underlying concept of GNUe security
is that the user has the basic responsibility for security and that
GNUe can only provide appropriate tools within its scope to support
the user in implementing security. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The basic goals of information security
are to protect information from disclosure to unauthorized recipients
(confidentiality), to ensure that only authorized sources make
changes to information (integrity), to ensure that the legitimate
users of a system can receive its services when required
(availability), to ensure that actions of an individual can be
uniquely traced to that individual (accountability) and to ensure
that agreements made electronically can be proven to have been made
(non&nbsp;repudiation).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Information security is always a
tradeoff. Perfect security does not exist in the real world. Any real
world system can be successfully attacked if the attacker is willing
to spend enough time and money. The defender's objective is to make
the time and cost of a successful attack much greater than either the
useful life or value of the information in the system. There is also
a tradeoff among the potential losses to the owner if information is
successfully attacked, the costs of protection, and the inconvenience
to legitimate users caused by the protective measures. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Within the scope of security the tasks
include providing protection, detecting intrusions, and recovering
from intrusions. In some cases, there is a tradeoff between
preventing an access and allowing the access but logging its
activity. In such cases improper activity is detected by evaluating
the logs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In general, an enterprise should
identify and inventory the data it expects to manage using GNUe,
perform the relevant tradeoffs, and establish security policies and
associated protections for each category of data it identifies. It
should then configure its implementation of GNUe to satisfy the
policies it adopts.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Establishment of security policies is a
function that must be performed at the highest levels of enterprise
governance, such as the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer,
Owner, Managing Partner, or other high level governing entity.  The
security policies must be aligned with other policies regarding
business practices, authority to perform business functions,
applicable laws snd contractual obligations of the enterprise, and
authority to originate, modify, and disseminate business documents. 
The scope of issues addressed in these policies must at least cover
the issues that would be addressed in policies governing records and
business processes intended to be implemented in paper documents.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Recovery from an intrusion involves
treating the computer system as a crime scene. Just as with a
physical crime scene, the system must be secured against disturbance
and evidence must be collected in a manner that is appropriate under
applicable law.  The System recovery can be started only after the
evidence has been collected and secured.  An example of a requirement
for evidence collection is the &ldquo;chain of custody&rdquo;
requirement  For example, in the US (and probably in many other
places) evidence is subject to a  in which an audit trail must be
established to document the custody and handling of the evidence.  If
the chain of custody can not be proven in court, the evidence can be
suppressed and disallowed

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Separation&nbsp;of&nbsp;duty is the
standard method used by organizations &nbsp;&nbsp; both business and
government &nbsp;&nbsp; for ensuring the integrity of their business
proceses. In general, separation&nbsp;of&nbsp;duty policies are an
ordinary part of the policies adopted under organizational
governance. These policies are commonly published in a policy manual
distributed to relevant managers and employees within the
organization. Examples of separation&nbsp;of&nbsp;duty policies
include:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Separation&nbsp;of&nbsp;duty policies
may depend on the size and scope of transactions or on other factors
as determined by the governing body of the organization. For example,
certain people may be authorized to commit the organization at
certain monetary values and risk levels, but increasing monetary
value or risk may require higher level approval.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Need-to-know and need-to-perform are
components of most security policies.  Users should be given access
only to data for which they have a business reason to access. 
Need-to-know applies to the confidentiality goal and need-to-perform
applies to the other goals.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Examples of need-to-know and
need-to-perform include the requirements that a patient's medical
records be accessible only by providers to that patients and others
whose duties require them to access the records.  Similar
requirements can apply to customer records, student records, and
other information.</P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.01in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in">
<FONT SIZE=3><I><B>2.3 	Legal trustworthiness requirements</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A legal trustworthiness requirement
generally arises out of the need for trustworthy recordkeeping for
official processes such as stockholder reporting, fiduciary
reporting, tax determination and auditing, and use as legal evidence
in trials. In all these cases there is a need for assurance that the
records in question are the complete and actual records they purport
to be and have not been altered since they were finalized. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As a general rule in computer systems,
if it is desired for data to be unalterable, the data must be
recorded on unalterable media. Regardless of how secure the operating
system may be, an appropriate group of people having sufficient
privileges on the system can do anything they want to do with any of
the data on the system. This is an important reason why, in the case
of an information security breach, it is usually required that all
relevant data (such as the contents of the hard drive) be immediately
written to CD&nbsp;Recordable media, sealed and labeled as
appropriate for evidence, and placed in a legally&nbsp;compliant
chain&nbsp;of&nbsp;custody.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">While criteria for the trustworthiness
of legal evidence (and even for some analog&nbsp;stored electronic
evidence) have been long established, the equivalent criteria for
digitally&nbsp;stored and computer&nbsp;based evidence are in their
infancy. The issues are being addressed in evolving policies,
legislation, and court cases related to e&nbsp;commerce, management
of digitally&nbsp;stored government records, and other areas.  Often,
the legal system is found to be seriously out&nbsp;of&nbsp;touch with
the world of technology and requires extensive education (and
sometimes the development of new institutional approaches) for
dealing with underlying technical issues.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One example of a legal trustworthiness
requirement is the Province of Quebec accounting auditability
statute. This statute was adopted after a situation in which it was
reported that some Quebec restauranteurs were using a &quot;zapper&quot;
program to delete sales records in point&nbsp;of&nbsp;sale terminals,
thereby reducing their reported tax liabilities by significant
percentages. After investigation, Quebec adopted a statute making it
illegal for any accounting&nbsp;related computer program to be
capable of deleting posted data, and providing severe penalties for
the use of such programs.</P>

requirements</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Critical infrastructure is a term for
facilities, including their information technology and communications
capabilities, that are deemed essential for public health, safety, or
critical economic reasons. Examples of critical infrastructure
facilities are banking, electric/gas/water utilities, transportation,
health care, and emergency services.  The assumed threat comes from
highly sophisticated potential attackers, such as organized crime,
international terrorists, or other international adversaries. These
potential attackers are assumed to have goals that may transcend the
specific nature of the facilities threatened, and may be willing to
spend large sums of money to achieve their goals.  Accordingly, the
protections that may be required are likely to go well beyond the
kinds of protections needed to defend against lesser threats.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Many organizations began in the late
1980's to adapt the hierarchical concept, traditionally used by
governments for military and diplomatic purposes, of categorizing the
needed intensity of protection for information based on the
consequences to the organization of a security breach.  The
consequence definitions generally apply to the security objectives of
confidentiality (consequences if the information is disclosed to
unauthorized recipients), integrity (consequences if the information
is maliciously modified or destroyed), and availability (consequences
if the information is made unavailable to legitimate users).  The
consequence definitions generally   include three levels, with a
possible fourth:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For at least the last decade,
government agencies and international standards bodies have been
engaged in a process of developing criteria for defining, evaluating,
and certifying security protection of computer systems and associated
networks.  The first of these criteria was developed in the 1970's to
address US Defense Department issues and is known as the &quot;Orange
Book&quot; (because of the color of its cover).  The Orange Book was
principally focused on confidentiality.  Expanded criteria, including
criteria for integrity, important to non-defense and commercial
users, have been developed by an international consortium of
information security agencies and have been adopted as an
international standard..  The criteria specify levels of trust,
including security features, development practices, documentation,
and test procedures.  The choice of which level of trust is
appropriate has been left to the user.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Orange Book criteria illustrate the
approach.  Orange Book Class D is security that is present but too
weak to evaluate.  Class C provides access control based on
data-owner&nbsp;determined permissions.  Subclass C1 provides basic
features, including passwords, access control, formal quality
assurance, and basic documentation.  Subclass C2 adds requirements
such as audit capability.  Class B adds requirements for security
sensitivity labels attached to files and security clearance levels
attached to user accounts.  A user can access a file only if the
file&rsquo;s owner has provided access permission <I>and</I> the
file&rsquo;s sensitivity label is at or below the user&rsquo;s
security clearance level.  Class B has three subclasses with
increasing requirements for features and quality assurance, such as
having a team of experts take several months full time to attack the
system.  Class A1 is similar to Class B3, except arcane mathematical
methods must be used to prove that the system meets its
specifications.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The expanded criteria developed by the
international consortium of information security agencies is known as
the Common Criteria and Methodology for Information Technology
Security Evaluation.  The equivalent international standard is
International Standards Organization IS&nbsp;15408, which has
formatting changes but is aligned with the Common Criteria. 
Information on the Common Criteria can be found on the US National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) web site.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Common Criteria provides a
collection of terms and specification components for preparing
Protection Profiles, which are user/acquirer expressions of their
security requirements, and Security Targets, which are provider
expressions of the security capabilities of their products. 
Protection Profiles and Security Targets have similar formats.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The international consortium has
established an arrangement for standardizing Protection Profiles and
for evaluating products against the profiles.  Work done in one
country under the Common Criteria arrangement is generally accepted
in all countries in the consortium.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Common Criteria provides a set of
Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL) that address the levels of trust
that can be placed in the security evaluations and products.  EAL-1
is similar to Orange Book Class D, i.e., security that is present but
too weak to evaluate.  EAL-2 is sometimes described as &ldquo;common,
commercial grade security.&rdquo;  EAL-4 is the highest level that
can be evaluated in the US on a commercial basis, i.e., outside
government auspices.  EAL-7 is comparable to Orange Book A-1,
requiring arcane and extrordinarily complex methods to demonstrate
that the security protection is provided.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The development methods required under
the Common Criteria are difficult to interpret and apply to software
developed under free/open-source software projects, that involve the
efforts of volunteer developers and reuse components resident in what
Lawrence Lessig (in his book The Future of Ideas) has called the
&ldquo;Innovation Commons.&rdquo;  The George Washington University
has a project to evaluate Security Enhanced Linux (discussed in
further detail in Section 6) under the Common Criteria as a pilot
study of how to apply the Common Criteria to free/open-source
software projects.  Their intent is to evaluate at EAL-2 in the next
year or so, and at EAL-4 within a few years.  They are working with
NIST to develop appropriate interpretations of the Common Criteria
that can be applied to similar projects.</P>

<FONT SIZE=3><I><B>4.1 	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Role Based Access Control essentially
implements the separation&nbsp;of&nbsp;duty approach that has long
been taken by businesses in protecting the integrity of their
business processes and critical data. Interest in RBAC arose as a
result of an evaluation of information security technology, which at
one time was focused on the confidentiality needs associated with
military and diplomatic matters. Recognition that business (and some
government) applications are more focused on the need for integrity
resulted both in the development of the Common Criteria for
Information Security Evaluation (ISO&nbsp;15408) and research
attention to RBAC. Indeed, one of the first examples of a Protection
Profile prepared and published using the Common Criteria was a
specification for evaluating RBAC.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The description of RBAC presented here
is based on a proposed standard for RBAC prepared by NIST. Under the
proposed standard, RBAC deals with the elements of Users, Roles,
Objects, Operations, and Permissions. A user is a person, but can be
extended to a process. A role is a job function within the context of
an organization. A user may be assigned multiple roles and a role may
be occupied by multiple users, although the relationship between
users and roles may be limited by constraints. Objects and operations
depend on the system context. For example, in a DBMS an object may be
a table and an operation may be a select or update. A permission is
the approval to perform the operation on the object.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Core RBAC requires the capabilities to
manage assignment of users to roles and manage assignment of
permissions to roles. It requires that a user be able to assume
multiple simultaneous roles. The proposed standard describes this as
capturing the functionality of group permissions in current operating
systems.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Hierarchical RBAC introduces role
hierarchies, with senior roles in the hierarchy inheriting the
permissions of their juniors and users assigned to senior roles being
assigned as well to the associated junior roles. Constrained RBAC
introduces separation&nbsp;of&nbsp;duty relationships, which are
static or dynamic constraints on the roles to which a user can be
simultaneously assigned. An example of a static constraint is that a
billing clerk is never allowed to also be an accounts receivable
clerk. An example of a dynamic relationship is that the originator of
a document is never also allowed to be the approver of the same
document, but may approve other documents.</P>

</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Discretionary Access Control is the
traditional &ldquo;user-group-other/read-write-execute&rdquo; type of
control traditionally found in operating systems and DBMS&rsquo;s. 
It is also the kind of control provided by access control lists. 
Under DAC, the owner of the data or file essentially has discretion
to provide access to whoever the owner determines should have access.
 The system enforces the owner&rsquo;s access decision, but does not
otherwise enforce constraints on access to the data.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Mandatory Access Control, objects
(e.g., data) and subjects (e.g., users, devices) are given
sensitivity labels according to a hierarchy.  The label is part of
the access control associated with the subject or object.  Security
policies govern the access and movement of objects by subjects.  An
example of a security policy is the &ldquo;Bell&nbsp;LaPadula
Security Model&rdquo; that prohibits a subject having a lower level
sensitivity label from reading an object having a higher sensitivity
label and also prohibits a subject having a higher level sensitivity
label from writing an object to a subject (e.g., a user directory or
a printer) having a lower sensitivity label.  The policy is often
summarized as &ldquo;No read up, no write down&rdquo; and is enforced
by the operating system.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Authentication is the process of
determining that the user is authentic, i.e., that the user is who
the user claims to be.  This is done by receiving information about
the user and comparing the received information to a stored version
of the information for the authentic user.  Up to three factors may
be used:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">!</FONT>	Something
the user has, such as a device or smartcard, usually identified by
some kind of encrypted information.  Some devices automatically

the user is, essentially data regarding a biometric characteristic of
the user, such as a fingerprint or eyeball pattern, generally stored
in some encryption&nbsp;protected format.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are numerous ways in which an
authentication system can be attacked and compromised.  These include
various means of tricking a user into revealing a password, various
strategies for guessing passwords and validating the accuracy of the
guesses, and various methods of capturing passwords (or other
authentication information) as it moves in the system.  There are
also ways in which an authentication system can be bypassed,
essentially involving attacks on the security of the overall system.

	Captured User Approaches</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A captured user approach involves
&ldquo;capturing&rdquo; or &ldquo;jailing&rdquo; the user to prevent
any access to capabilities that a malicious user could exploit to
engage in unauthorized activities on the system.  For example, this
would generally involve sending the user from system login directly
into a menu system from which the user can't escape.  Sending the
user into the menu system generally involves a function that is
automatically executed upon startup of a computer or upon user login.
 However, there are a wide variety of system functions that must be
blocked to ensure that the user remains captured.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In general, the capturing fails if a
user is able to access a system prompt, or also in the case of GNUe a
Python traceback and prompt, that enables access to commands that can
be used for performing functions that support disallowed activity. 
Among other things, this may mean that the user must be prevented
from starting the system or logging in without going throught the
auto-execute function that starts the menu system.  It means that
functions that can stop a process and return to the system prompt
(such as Control-C or Control-Z on some systems) must be disabled. 
It means that any exception that could result in a crash leading to a
Python traceback or system prompt must be handled and returned
instead to the menu system.  It is best if functionality not needed
by a legitimate user is not present on the system.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Captured user approaches are good for
purposes such as point-of-sale terminals and specialized kiosk
terminals.  Also, any user accessing a web page is essentially a
captured user of the system containing the web server.</P>

Other educational records include &ldquo;admissions, personal,

placement records.&rdquo;  There are rules for access to these
records.  According to the policies, &ldquo;Educational records do
not include the records of instructional, administrative, and

are not accessible or revealed to any individual except a temporary

which case the institution will permit access only to that part of
the record which pertains to the inquiring student. The institution
is not required to permit students to inspect and review confidential

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A project is ongoing to provide support
in Linux kernel 2.5 (development version of kernel release 2.6) for
loadable kernel modules that can implement a variety of security
improvements and security&nbsp;hardened versions now offered as
kernel patches.  The Loadable Kernel Module effort has developed
&quot;kernel hooks&quot; that can be used by a wide range of modules,
and includes a &ldquo;stacker&rdquo; that enables multiple modules to
be used..  The loadable modules will come with the system, just as
modules for various devices are currently supplied.  A user can
install a module using the &quot;insmod&quot; command and the system
will then enforce the security policy it provides (subject, of course
to the appropriate configuration of the security policy.   The
modules offer options that both increase and reduce security.  For
example, there is a module that eliminates the security that is
already provided in the kernel to support the needs of some real&nbsp;time
critical users who can't afford the time it takes for the existing,
built&nbsp;in access control.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Security hardened or enhanced
versions of Linux</I></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are a variety of projects or
proposals for enhancing the security of Linux. These include
security&nbsp;hardened distributions (or modifications to
distributions) and projects for enhancement of Linux security.
Security Enhanced Linux (SE&nbsp;Linux) is one of the most important
new concepts for improvement of Linux security (and indeed for
advancement of operating system security in general). Rule Set Based
Access Control (RSBAC) is another enhancement that has a research
basis comparable to that of SE&nbsp;Linux. There are other proposals
and offerings also available.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SE&nbsp;Linux is a concept posted on
the NSA web site.  It includes all the additions as a kernel patch
currently being incorporated into the Loadable Kernel Module version.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SE&nbsp;Linux combines RBAC with other
security methods known as Type Enforcement and (optionally)
Multi&nbsp;Level Security sensitivity labels. All three security
methods are used in conjunction with a set of user&nbsp;defined
policies. The RBAC and Type Enforcement create a large number of
categorizations including object classes, domains, types, and roles.
For example, object classes include processes, files, directories,
character device, block device, socket, and numerous other system
elements. Within each object class there may be a number of types.
For example, there may be a type associated with a specific operating
system function, such as creation of the system log. User&nbsp;defined
policies could even extend types to specific user functions, such as
approving expense vouchers. Users and processes are also assigned
roles, such as ordinary user, system administrator, purchasing agent,
financial auditor, and other organization&nbsp;related categories. 
Sensitivity labels can be optionally used to identify data according
to categories of consequences resulting from unauthorized disclosure,
alteration, destruction, or denial&nbsp;of&nbsp;use.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In SE&nbsp;Linux, all accesses and
transitions among objects of various types and users of various roles
are governed by permissions defined by policy rules and enforced by a
reference monitor that is part of the operating system kernel. The
permissions are much more fine&nbsp;grained than in current Linux
systems. For example, existing Linux systems define permissions of
read, write, and execute but SE&nbsp;Linux permissions may also
include create, get attributes, set attributes, create hard link,
lock/unlock, mount, unmount, and others.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RSBAC offers support for a variety of
&quot;rule sets&quot; each of which supports a different kind of
security policy. In RSBAC, the rule sets can also be combined. The

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An enterprise is assumed to have
appropriate physical protections as part of its security policies and
to enforce appropriate common practices such as password discipline.
Depending on the capabilities of the operating system, DBMS,
middleware, and other security&nbsp;relevant components of the
enterprises GNUe configuration, certain security policies will need
to be enforced by paperwork or other manual procedures.  For example,
instead of having some transactions approved on&nbsp;line, the
enterprise could have the transactions approved in a paperwork system
and then entered on&nbsp;line after approval.</P>

would be to split the form into read/write areas, read&nbsp;only
areas, and action areas each defined by a partial gfd. Implementation
of the full form would require two or more of the partial gfd's.
Users would be allowed access to the appropriate version (read/write,

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In some cases, actions will involve

the transaction will require either that the access permisions on the
file containing the transaction data be changed from pre&nbsp;approval
access to post&nbsp;approval access, or that the transaction data be
moved from a file allowing pre&nbsp;approval access to another file
allowing only post&nbsp;approval access. The former case involves
security calls to the operating system to change the relevant
permissions. The latter case may involve security calls to allow the
movement of the data to take place.</P>

	Security for Appserver</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Appserver is the GNUe tool that manages
multi-tier architectures.  Appserver is intended to provide a
consistent interface to the user client regardless of where or how in
a system any particular item of data is actually stored.  Appserver
security is made challenging because of the complexity of mapping
data items from the user side of appserver to the database side. 
Having the operating system or database system provide security
requires that the mapping be traced and the various data items
appropriately protected.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In certain cases, there are potential
security requirements that can not be met by either a particular
operating system or a particular database system.  Appserver can be
provided with its own internal security functions.  Such functions
are likely to have a lower level of security assurance than functions
provided by an operating system, although it may be possible to
improve the quality of protection by using very simple approaches and
providing as much protection as possible using the operating system.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main point here is that the
security features of Appserver must be approached very carefully to
avoid precluding their use by enterprises having demanding
requirements for security.</P>

RBAC focused on transactions</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This policy involves roles that are
static, i.e., each person has a limited number of roles that do not
change.  It is also focused on transactions, i.e., the access control
is by specific screens or reports associated with the transaction..</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One way of implementing such a policy
would be by operating system access controls placed on the gfd and
grd files associated with the transactions, together with providing a
set of gpd files, one for each role, capable only of initiating the
activities allowable for the role.  The system would need to be
configured so a user could not substitute a tampered copy of a gfd,
grd, or gpd file by somehow redirecting the system to use the
tampered copy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the transactions involve some
critical individual database tables, access control could also be
placed on those tables using the access control facilities provided
by the database system.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 0.17in"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>8,2

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Examples of this would include patient
records accessible only by providers to that patient, student records
accessible only by personnel of the department in which the student
is enrolled, or customer financial records accessible only by
personnel of the office at which the customer has an account.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One relatively secure way to support
this kind of policy would be to place the record of each patient,
student, or customer in a separate operating system file, such as a
flat file, an XML file, or a Dbase dbf file.  Access control could
then be provided by the operating system, and the files could be
easily moved if the status of the patient, student, or customer
changed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another approach would be to create a
set of database tables having access limited to the providers,
department, or office providing service, and to move the records to
those tables.</P>

control on database fields</B></I></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">An example of this policy would be one
that restricts the users allowed to access price information.  If
only a few screens contain price infomation, the same strategy
discussed above in Section 8.1 could be used.  If numerous screens
contain price information the challenge becomes more difficult.  Some
database systems allow access control by field.  If one of these is
being used, the facility that supports that access control could
support the policy.  If such a database is not being used, it will be
necessary to use access control facilities provided by GNUe.  The
GNUe facilities provide less assurance than an operating system or
database system, and the user must take that lower assurance into
account in evaluating the risk of disclosong database field
information to unauthorized personnel.</P>

This could be done at the end of each accounting period. From an
information security viewpoint, this effectively keeps the records
added to the database since the last CD&nbsp;R writing in the state
of In instance of approval, because it is feasible for a sufficient
number of people having a sufficient combination of privileges on the
computer system to modify the database until it is written to CD&nbsp;R.
Modification of the unrecorded database would be feasible even with
the most advanced security systems currently envisioned in the
