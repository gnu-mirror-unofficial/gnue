<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.1"></a> <b>1.1 - What is GNUe?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe stands for GNU Enterprise. GNUe is both free software and a
modular architecture that provides automated support for most business
processes. This type of software is sometimes referred to as Enterprise
Software. Many proprietary commercial Enterprise Software applications
exist (i.e. from manufacturers like SAP, Manugistics, PeopleSoft, etc.)
that provide similar functionality. 
</p>
<p>
GNUe installation will typically provide integrated business software
for human resources, payroll, inventory, purchasing, accounting,
finance, planning, sales order entry, customer support, forecasting,
and other business processes. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.2"></a> <b>1.2 - What makes GNUe different?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe is free software and built around open standards for the most
popular computer systems in the world. It is also designed from the
ground up as a modular international system utilizing the latest in
object technology. Object technology means that parts of the overall
system may be improved and capabilities added without monolithic or
system wide changes. International design includes capability for
multiple currencies, languages and international support. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.3"></a> <b>1.3 - How do I get help with or better understand GNUe?</b> 
</p>
<p>
First, read the documentation. It can be found at the
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/project/docs-all.html">
GNUe Docs Page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
There are also numerious text files in the distributions and in CVS.
</p>
<p>
Most decisions and discussions regarding GNUe occur on the GNUe IRC chat channel.
An excellent summary of recent discussions can be found at the
<a href="http://kt.zork.net/GNUe/archives.html">Kernel Cousin GNUe Archives</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once you are familiar with the documentation and recent IRC discussions
you may want to review the
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/mail.html">mail list archives</a>. 
</p>
<p>
After you are up-to-date the GNUe supporters would be happy to answer
your question via email lists or on
<a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/community/irc.html">IRC Chat</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.4"></a> <b> 1.4 - How do I report suggestions, errors or omission in this FAQ? </b> 
</p>
<p>
All suggestions, errors, omission or other comments regarding the GNUe
FAQ should be emailed to <a

</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.5"></a> <b>1.5 - Who contributed to this FAQ?</b> 
</p>
<p>
This FAQ was originally written in November 2000 and is maintained by
Neil Tiffin. Contributors to this FAQ include, in no particular order,
Derek Neighbors, James Thompson, Andrew Murie, Alan Clifford, Reinhard
Muller, Andrew Hill, Peter Sullivan and Jason Cater. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.6"></a> <b>1.6 - When was this FAQ last revised and where can I find it.</b>. 
</p>
<p>
This FAQ is $ Revision: 1.29 $ $Date: 2003/01/05 00:00:17 $. The most
recent version (automatically updated from CVS) can be found on <a
href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/faq.html">
the GNU GNUe Project FAQ Page</a>. A mini version is
located <a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/faq/minifaq.html">

</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.7"></a> <b>1.7 - What is Enterprise Software?</b> 
</p>
<p>
Enterprise Software refers to a software system where most of the
software used to operate a business is integrated together and business
information is maintained in a way that reduces or eliminates
duplication, provides timely access by all parts of the organization,
provides a high level of accuracy, and requires minimal manual
intervention. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.8"></a> <b>1.8 - Why is GNUe being developed?</b> 
</p>
<p>
	As an alternative to proprietary systems because: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
proprietary systems can be very expensive over the life of the
software. If you have a system that works why should you pay a huge
monthly fee just for the privilege of using the system. 
	</li>
	<li>
proprietary systems are usually designed by computer companies, not end
users. GNUe is flexible and designed to support realistic business
processes and future development is driven by users. 
	</li>
	<li>
proprietary systems may have limited life and are proprietary. If the
proprietary system manufacturer or outside consultant goes out of
business (or your internal technical developer leaves) you may end up
with no reliable support. Why should you pay for a manufacturers poor
business practices? GNUe is free software. This provides you with
everything needed to support the software yourself -- even if everyone
else quits using it. The GNUe project is designed as a cooperative
effort. This will benefit all users in the long run. 
	</li>
	<li>
GNUe offers unparalleled flexibility. You may use an existing business
model, expand upon an existing business model, or create your own
business model from scratch. 
	</li>
	<li>
small businesses can get the same benefit from GNUe that previously
were only available to large businesses using proprietary enterprise
software. 
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.9"></a> <b> 1.9 - How does GNUe compare to
Quickbooks, PeachTree or other shrink-wrapped accounting software? </b> 
</p>
<p>
It doesn't. GNUe is professional strength software designed for
multi-user operating systems with either a two or three tier client
server architecture. It is built to be scalable and maintainable --
supporting organizations with over 2000 users. Of course, it will also
support organizations with just a few users and run on a single
computer (with just a little overkill). It can be run out of the box or
completely customized by developers. It is free. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.10"></a> <b>1.10 - What is Free Software?</b> 
</p>
<p>
The GNUe project fully supports the concept of Free Software. See <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.11"></a> <b> 1.11 - Why is GNUe licensed under the GPL and what does this mean? </b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe is released under the GPL license. Please see the sample GPL
license at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>. The actual license covering
GNUe is included in all GNUe distributions. 
</p>
<p>
For a description of why GPL and why free software see <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html">
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.12"></a> <b>1.12 - How do I help the GNUe effort?</b> 
</p>
<p>
Become familiar with the GNUe system; then, email <a
href="mailto:info@gnue.org">info@gnue.org</a>. There is always
something that needs to be done. We need all types of talent --
programming, documentation, business process analysis, and, most
importantly, users. Please don't be bashful. 
</p>
<p>
To formally contribute to GNUe, we will require a signed Free Software
Foundation copyright assignment. More information can be obtained by
sending email indicating your area of interest to <a

<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-1.13"></a> <b>1.13 - What standard technologies or standards are used in GNUe?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe potentially makes use of SGML, HTML, XML, XML-EDI, CORBA, SQL, and
several GNU technologies. No doubt some I missed. 
</p>
<p>

	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.1"></a> <b>2.1 - What is the GNUe architecture (short version)?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe is an n-tier client server enterprise system. The user interface
is provided by GNUe Forms client. The GNUe Forms client talks directly
to the GEAS (enterprise application server) using CORBA technology.
GEAS currenty connects to SQL92 relational databases using API calls.
GEAS also manages the business objects which consist of data and
business rules. 
</p>
<p>
The backend use of a standard SQL92 relational database provides
standard interfaces for external systems and leverages current IT
practices and staff. This was an important consideration for
simplifying the migration to GNUe and the integration of GNUe with
other systems ( <a href="#GNUe-FAQ-2.16">see 2.16</a>). For 2-tier,
backend support includes most major relational databases including DB2,
Oracle, Sybase, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. For n-tier support, only MySQL
and PostgreSQL are supported at this time.

<p>
Internally, GNUe n-tier is object based. The objects contain data and
business rules with data stored in an SQL database. The business
objects are accessed using CORBA and we use Python-orbit for binding
Python to our current ORB ORBit. Therefore the business rules are
written in Python. Since other bindings exist, a developer is not
necessarily limited to Python.

	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.2"></a> <b>2.2 - What is GNUe-Forms and GNUe-Designer?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe-Forms is a platform and UI-independent forms system. It reads an
XML-based forms definition and creates GUIs for Win32, GTK, and, soon,
Curses and HTML. It has a fully data-aware widget set and can be used
in both 2-tier and n-tier environments. 
</p>
<p>
GNUe-Designer is the IDE for the GNUe tools. It allows you to visually
layout your forms in a RAD-style environment. Designer has a builtin
forms client, so you can quickly test your forms while still in
Designer. Designer also now has support for form creation wizards...
answer a few questions, attach your form to a table, select the fields
to include, and, voila, a basic form is created. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.3"></a> <b>2.3 - What is GNUe-Common?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe-Common is the basis for the GNUe tools, such as Forms, Reports,
and Designer. It implements a database-abstraction layer that provides
support for most major databases. A builtin XML-to-Object parser and
Object-to-XML marshaller are used by Forms, Reports, and Designer to
save and read Forms/Report definitions to and from an XML file. Work
has begun on an RPC-abstraction layer that will allow server processes
to define their public methods once and have them available to CORBA,
XML-RPC, SOAP, and DCOM clients. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.4"></a> <b>2.4 - What is GNUe Application Server (AppServer)?</b> 
</p>
<p>
AppServer is a data abstraction layer and allows GNUe to utilize single API
to all data sources (local and remote). So the client has one set of
calls it uses, but can access different vendors SQL databases or even
CVS or XML files. Similar to Borland's Database Engine or other data
abstraction tiers. AppServer is transparent to the user. It will run with
multiple instances and do load balancing. AppServer is required for n-tier
operation. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.5"></a> <b>2.5 - What is GNUe Reports (GNUeR)?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe Reports shares many features with GNUe Forms. It is comprised of a
report designer and a client that generates the requested output.
Report definition files are also XML based. And programs can
communicate directly with the XML reports definition language much like
they can with GNUe Forms. The major difference is that GNUe Reports is
optimized to handle large amounts of data and run separately from the
GNUe Forms Client. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.6"></a> <b>2.6 - What is GNU Bayonne?</b> 
</p>
<p>
Integration of non-transaction based ad-hoc communications utilizing
fax, email and paging other non-network communications with GNUe.
Transaction based external communications (EDI and XML-EDI) will
utilize the <a href="#GNUe-FAQ-2.8">Data Transformation</a> Tool. To
use EWOK the user would typically hit the EWOK button in the Forms
client and a pop-up window would appear with destination and
information selection options. This may be replaced with Bayonne. This
change is in process, see the news section for more information. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.7"></a> <b>2.7 - What database does GNUe require?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe n-tier (AppServer) and GNUe 2-tier both work with a wide range of 
backends, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, DB2, Sybase, Interbase, 
SAP-DB, ODBC, etc.). The current list of supported databases is 
listed <a href="http://www.gnuenterprise.org/tools/common.html">on
the website</a>. The
internal structure of GNUe AppServer is object based but stores information
in a standard SQL92 relational database. It is anticipated that GNUe
will interface to any SQL92 (odbc, oracle, sybase, interbase, etc)
standard relational database. The API design does not limit the storage
to RDMS.

<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.11"></a> <b>2.11 - What GUIs work with GNUe?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe Forms currently supports (some are tested more than others) win32,
gtk, motif, curses and mac GUI. A Java client is being authored as well
and a web client is anticipated in the very near future. 
</p>
<p>
GNUe Designer uses the wxWindows widget set, which currently supports
Win32, GTK, and Motif. &nbsp;Soon, wxWindows will support MacOS and
QT/KDE. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.12"></a> <b>2.12 -&nbsp;</b> Why Python? Why not Java or Perl? 
</p>
<p>
If you want Java, LinuxKontor is probably a better choice for you.
Because of Java's popularity, some of the GNUe team is working on a
Java forms client (although it is not a priority and, therefore, is not
actively maintained). We do know that Java applications can connect to
a AppServer backend via Java's CORBA support. However, Java is NOT the
preferred language for our clients as it has issues with its ownership.
Because this is a free software project we will provide all
functionality using free software. Also, at the time, Java did not have
any usable widget sets -- swing was/is too slow to be used in an
application setting. 
</p>
<p>
Perl is another widely used, free high-level scripting language with
many similarities to Python. The early developers chose Python over
Perl because of Python's maintainability (clean code) and
object-oriented nature. Perl does not scale well in a large project
with multiple active developers. It is quite common for a developer to
write a perl script and, 6 months later, not have a clue what the
script was designed to do. It is commonly said that perl is better
suited for smaller, one-time projects.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
Other free scripting languages could have been used. However, the same
arguments against Perl usually hold for these as well. Perhaps other
languages would have worked just as well. The bottom line, however, is
that Python was chosen early on, has a tremendous standard library, has
proven itself with respect to clean code, and is well-liked by the GNUe
developers, so we see no reason to change. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.13"></a> <b>2.13 - What about Windows or Macintosh support?</b> 
</p>
<p>
The GNUe Application Server works natively on Mac OS X. It does
not currently work on Windows, but support is anticipated. 
</p>
<p>
GNUe Forms and GNUe Designer use the wxPython/wxWindows abstraction
library, which currently provides widget support for GTK, Motif, and
Windows 9x/XP/NT/2000. A Mac OS X port of wx is being heavily worked
on, but is currently not usable. A QT/KDE port for wx is also under
development. Work is also under way on Curses and HTML frontends for
GNUe Forms. 
</p>
<p>
GNUe Reports runs on most platforms supported by Python. The primary
limitation will be the driver for your database backend. For example,
while GNUe Reports will run on Windows, a corresponding PostgreSQL
driver may not be available.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.14"></a> <b>2.14 - What about network traffic, bandwith and thin clients?</b> 
</p>
<p>
All network flow is all by ORBit. We would expect same type of traffic
as a MIDAS client or DCOM client on windows. We are middle ground
bandwidth wise and thin client wise. GNUe doesn't use bandwidth
whenever you move the mouse etc. The forms code is an XML form that is
interpreted by the client. Its only when you do an event relating to
the backend that it sends traffic (i.e. event driven). The only
possible issue, we anticipate, would be latency with internet
deployment with using thin clients talking to GEAS on other side of the
world. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.15"></a> <b> 2.15 - How do I create a simple form? Where is it stored and how do I run it? </b> 
</p>
<p>
The form is an XML file. You can create it with any editor or with GNUe
Designer. Then you can run it remotely by typing "gfclient
http://myserver.com/some_form.gfd" or locally by typing "gfclient
/path/to/file/some_form.gfd".&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.16"></a> <b>2.16 - How will external systems interface to GNUe?</b> 
</p>
<p>
External systems may interface with GNUe in two ways. The simple and
more standard way is to connect directly with the SQL backend
relational database. The downside to this method is that it will bypass
all business logic built into GNUe business objects. So some business
logic will be duplicated in the external systems. Also database tables
are considered very changeable for upgrades and extensions, therefore
external systems using this method will require more maintenance than
those using the GNUe API method. 
</p>
<p>
The other way for external systems to interface with GNUe is to connect
directly to the Application Server using the GNUe API. This method is not as
standard but will provide better data integrity as all data will be
subject to the business rules defined in GNUe business objects. It will
also be less prone to changes as we expect the GNUe API to change less
than the SQL tables will change. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.17"></a> <b>2.17 - What is a Business Object?</b> 
</p>
<p>
A Business Object is an encapsulated unit of information and methods
that relate to the business. For example a customer is a Business
Object. Also a purchase order, a line item on a purchase order and a
receipt against a line item on a purchase order are all Business
Objects related to each other. Business objects are defined by the
developer in .gcd files. The .gcd file may also define methods and
triggers for the Business Objects. 
</p>
<p>
	An example Business Object without methods: 
</p>
<p>
	<font face="Courier New,Courier,Monaco"> class contact 
		<br>
		{ 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;&nbsp;name&lt;25&gt;; 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;int16&nbsp;age; 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;float net_worth; 
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;text&nbsp;&nbsp;notes; 
		<br>
		}; 
		<br>
	</font> 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.18"></a> <b>2.18 - What are Business Rules?</b> 
</p>
<p>
Business Rules are methods defined for classes. Currently business
rules are implemented in Python or C. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.19"></a> <b>2.19 - Why Not Glade instead of GNUe Forms?</b> 
</p>
<p>
GNUe Forms and Glade are two separate types of tools. Comparing one to
the other is, pardon the cliche, like comparing apples to oranges. 
</p>
<p>
Glade is a powerful, yet special-purpose, GUI layout application. It is
specifically designed to generate GUI layouts for a GTK/GNOME
application and is very well suited for such a task. If you are wanting
to design a GUI for a non-data-aware app that runs only under
Gnome/GTK, then you should look at Glade. 
</p>
<p>
However, one of the main goals of GNUe Forms is to be independent of
any particular user interface. Using a single form definition, your
data-aware application will work on various graphical desktops
(Windows, GTK/GNOME, KDE, Mac, Motif) as well as via a text-only
(curses) interface and a web browser (HTML). We are even looking at
designing a Bayonne forms client -- your form could be accessed via a
telephone! 
</p>
<p>
Also, one of the primary draws of Forms is its fully data-aware widget
set. &nbsp;Glade would require you to program any database logic
yourself. Forms provides a natural link between an on-screen form and a
database backend with very little, if any, programming. 
</p>
<p>
	<a name="GNUe-FAQ-2.20"></a> <b>2.20 - Why not Mozilla's XUL instead of GNUe Forms?</b> 
</p>
<p>
"Tonight Derek was reading over some of the documentation on GNUe. It
occurred to me that Mozilla and XUL might make a great front end UI to
this system. Instead of creating multiple GUI front ends for the
different environments you wish to support, you could make one XUL
front end that could run on every platform that Mozilla can run on (and
there are a lot). Is there some reason you've chosen not to do this?" 
</p>
<p>
This has been talked about in infinite detail, but the summary is that
browsers don't make good front ends for Enterprise systems. They are a
nice option, but most data-entry style applications are not "friendly"
when used from a browswer. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, there were a few key issues with using Mozilla as our
primary interface: 
</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>
Mozilla is a bit 'heavy' for a client. (Now I realize we could have
just reused the rendering engine (gecko) and wrapped it, but thats
pretty significant work in and of itself. 
	</li>
	<li>
The concept of data aware widgets doesn't exist to the mozilla team
unless of course you are willing to do all data in RDF/RSS format. Our
enterprises, of course, dont store data in this format. :) I have
recently restarted XUL conversations on this and think it would be do
able. However, once again there is an issue that it would be a lot of
work. 
	</li>
	<li>
At the time we started GNUe over 2 years ago, XUL was severely
infantile and mozilla still was not 'widely' adopted. This was around
M10 releases. If you doubt we didn't make serious efforts search for my
name (derek) or my sig at that time XULFool and you will see us active
in many irc sessions, mailing lists etc. For sometime I had wanted to
use XUL. 
	</li>
	<li>
At the time .... Mozilla was under MPL only which made it iffy at best
for us to use as a GNU project. 
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
Since Forms is designed to be UI-independent, it is worth noting that
someone could write a XUL driver for Forms. This would allow those who
would prefer an XUL interface to do so, but would not in any way make
Mozilla the primary interface of Forms.
