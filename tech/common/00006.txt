Title: Trigger Extension for datasources
Status: Current
Created: 2002-09-04

Introduction
------------

A GDatasource object as defined in GDatasource.py is providing the following
functions in its trigger namespace:

- createResultSet(conditions={}, readOnly=0)    load a new resultset into the
                                                datasource

- simpleQuery(maskDict)                         load a new resultset into the
                                                datasource and return that 
						result as an dictionary object


The following functions are provided in the global trigger namespace too:

- delete()                                      delete the current record

- call(name,params)      ***ALPHA***            call a function "name" on the
                                                current record. This function
                                                just works in connection with
                                                appserver as an db backend.


Examples
