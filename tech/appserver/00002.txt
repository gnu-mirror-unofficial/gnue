The Class Repository holds all information about the structure of the business
objects.

To use the Class Repository, you need to "from gnue.appserver import classrep".

Please regard all class repository object as read-only object. To change data
in the class repository, access the underlying business objects.


The Module Object
=================

The global variable "classrep.modules" holds a dictionary of all modules. Each
module is represented by a module object, the key is the module name.

All properties of the gnue_module business object (described in the API
documentation) are also accessible as properties of the module Python object.
Apart from that, the module Python object has a property "classes" that lists
all classes defined by that module (in the form of a dictionary).


The Class Object
================

A dictionary of classes originally defined by a specific module can be obtained
from "module.classes". A dictionary of all classes is available in the global
variable "classrep.classes". Both dictionaries use the fully qualified class
name as key.

All properties of the gnue_class business object (described in the API
documentation) are also accessible as properties of the class Python object.

Apart from that, the class Python object has these properties:

* module: The module originally defining the class
* fullName: The fully qualified name
* table: The underlying database table
* properties: A dictionary of all properties of the class, where the fully
  qualified property name acts as the key


The Property Object
===================

All properties of the gnue_property business object (described in the API
documentation) are also accessible as properties of the corresponding Python
object.

Apart from that, the Python object of class "Property" has the following
properties:

* fullName: The fully qualified name
* column: The underlying database column (or None if it is a calculated
  property (not yet implemented))
