Title: Form's "Pre-Positioning" Wizards and Templates
Status: Current
Created: 22 July 2002

Displayable/positionable widgets need a location on screen. To facilitate
the writing of Wizards/Templates for such elements without having to resort
to asking the user for x/y coordinates, form's TemplateSupport introduces
the FormPrePositioningTemplate.  The primary difference is that, instead of
the Wizard implementing a Start() method, the wizard should implement:

  def StartWithPositioning(self, root, current, x, y, width, height):

The wizard should not define a Start() method as the FormPrePositioningTemplate
uses the Start() method for it's own code.

width and height can be None if the user did not use a drag box to define
the widget's size.  In that case, the wizard should, if appropriate, use
sane defaults for these two.

If either width or height are irrelevant to your element, these attributes
can simply be ignored.
